        "Whenever I write about the ascent of\n",
        " modern RISC processors such as Arm and RISC-V, I always get comments about how RISC processors failed to take on Intel in the past and that they are doomed to fail again.\n",
        "It is true that there was a battle between RISC and CISC processors in the 1990s. At the time workstations from companies such as Sun, Silicon Graphics and Acorn were hot stuff. Computers magazines had lots of stories about them. I remember going to conferences back then and seeing mostly Unix workstations rather than Windows machines. However, within a relatively few years these Unix workstations were pretty much all gone.\n",
        "The question people cannot stop asking is: Why would history not repeat itself? Will x86 not always end up victorious in the end?\n",
        "To understand why this will not happen this time around, we need to understand why RISC workstations lost back in the day and why then everything will be different this time around.\n",
        "Intel’s Volume Advantage in the 90s\n",
        "Production volume matters a lot when it comes to the cost of chips. Large and advanced independent chip manufacturers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), which makes chips for Apple and many others today, did not exist in the 90s.\n",
        "The one who had the most advanced manufacturing capability and the highest volume was Intel. RISC processors at the time were cheaper to design as they were simpler. However, lower volume meant higher unit prices.\n",
        "Intel had the opposite situation. They had much higher design costs as the x86 instruction set made chips harder to design. However, due to their volume, they could produce chips at a lower cost per unit.\n",
        "For high-end workstations which would be low volume, there was an obvious advantage with RISC chips. You could design higher-performance chips at a lower cost. For low-volume workstations, Intel would not be able to compete as their design cost could not be amortized across enough volume of chips.\n",
        "The Unix workstations ended up with advanced custom-made hardware at every level which supported all sorts of fancy features such as hot-plugging hardware at runtime, and extremely fast memory. I think some workstations even let you add a CPU while it was running but don’t quote me on that.\n",
        "Combined this produced awesome RISC machines at eye-watering prices.\n",
        "Open vs Closed Platform\n",
        "Closed platforms may give a better overall user experience, just look at Apple. The problem is that you end up with premium prices. All the RISC workstation vendors were like Apple: They sold premium products at premium prices.\n",
        "The problem with such a business model is that the low-end competitor always ends up improving and closing in on you. The low-end has the benefit of volume which means high-end products very often lose out to low-end products moving up the value chain.\n",
        "The Threat of “Good Enough”\n",
        "The problem for RISC-based workstations was that eventually, PCs started getting good enough. They still had flaws compared to RISC-based workstations but the PCs could offer far more software and much lower prices. Thus Intel started gradually eating into the market of RISC workstations which then had to decide whether to fight in the low-end of their business or try to race ahead at the high-end.\n",
        "With higher volume and higher total profits, Intel could afford to throw a lot more money at designing chips than the RISC guys. They could also use smaller node sizes to increase performance without actually having better-designed chips than the RISC guys. This made Intel gradually erode the RISC advantage.\n",
        "They never stood a chance because they began at the high-end not the low end.\n",
        "Did Pentium Become More RISC-like Kill RISC Processors?\n",
        "In 1996 Intel shipped the Pentium Pro (P6) and their marketing material started hyping up the chip had basically been a RISC processor which could run x86 instructions. It was sold as having an exterior that could chop up x86 instructions into RISC instructions. A lot of people will point to this transition as the real reason Intel won. But there are many problems with that story. Bob Colwell who designed the Pentium Pro at Intel actually vehemently rejects that there is anything RISC-like about the processor:\n",
        "Intel’s x86’s do NOT have a RISC engine “under the hood.” They implement the x86 instruction set architecture via a decode/execution scheme relying on mapping the x86 instructions into machine operations, or sequences of machine operations for complex instructions, and those operations then find their way through the microarchitecture, obeying various rules about data dependencies and ultimately time-sequencing.\n",
        "The “micro-ops” that perform this feat are over 100 bits wide, carry all sorts of odd information, cannot be directly generated by a compiler, are not necessarily single cycle. But most of all, they are a microarchitecture artifice — RISC/CISC is about the instruction set architecture.\n",
        "This debate has been ongoing for a long time. I wrote a story comparing RISC and CISC getting into this very topic: What Does RISC and CISC Mean in 2020?\n",
        "Joel Hruska followed up with a great article later which makes a different conclusion from mine: RISC vs. CISC Is the Wrong Lens for Comparing Modern x86, ARM CPU.\n",
        "Actually, I think Joel makes the most compelling arguments, but I will not delve into those details here. One can debate this issue at length but at the end of the day, it is not that relevant. Intel found ways to combat the advantage of RISC processors but there was still no inherent technical advantage in having a CISC processor. Having an x86 instruction set did not give Intel processors a performance advantage no matter how you look at it. At the end of the day having more cash to spend on making better micro-architecture and more sophisticated manufacturing made the difference.\n",
        "Why RISC Today is Totally Different From the 90s\n",
        "Today the chip game is completely reverse. Arm did not start by selling high-end RISC workstations. Instead, they began by dominating the low-end chips market made up of micro-controllers, embedded devices, dumb phones, and smartphones. In 2020 25 billion Arm-based chips got shipped. In comparison, the whole PC market in 2020 was 275 million units. Think about that! That is two orders of magnitude difference.\n",
        "Here is a crazy fact few seem to have picked up about the world we live in today. People are used to thinking about Apple as being the small player. Macs have about a 10% market share of the computer market. So in people’s minds, Apple is a small player. What people fail to take into account is how dominant smartphones and tablets have become. An iPhone today frequently costs significantly more than a desktop computer or laptop. You got plenty of smartphones capable of outperforming low-end PCs.\n",
        "These devices have high-end CPUs in them. Many of Apple’s iPad models have M1 chips inside. The very same chip used in many of their popular desktops and laptops. Thus in terms of CPU capability, it does not make that much sense to separate these markets. So here is a simple statistic that will blow your mind: Apple shipped a total of 285 million iPhones, iPads, and Macs in 2020.\n",
        "\n",
        "Comparing the total PC market with total units shipped by Apple with Arm chips inside\n",
        "Thus there are more CPUs going into Apple products than there are CPUs going into the whole PC market. Thus being king-of-the-hill in the PC market isn’t that big of a deal. This market is what Intel owns but it simply isn’t that big of a market. Apple alone is making of CPUs than Intel.\n",
        "So if you look at the whole Arm market it is clear that the idea that x86 is still the dominant player is just ludicrous. Arm already won. Intel and AMD today are where the RISC workstation guys were in the 90s. They god the high high-end while facing a high-volume competitor which is rapidly catching up.\n",
        "x86 Performance Edge is Not Going to Hold\n",
        "The fastest supercomputers today are built using Arm,s not x86 chips. Intel and AMD are able to outperform the chips made by Apple but only at the cost of insane power usage. That is not a sustainable strategy to maintain an edge. Apple has the clear lead in terms of performance per watt. Now Apple cares more about slim design and long battery life than Intel and AMD which both make a lot of money on delivering to data centers. Thus they are not directly competing across the whole product lineup.\n",
        "But other companies such as Amazon, Ampere, and Nvidia are making Arm chips for data centers which will compete directly with AMD and Intel. Ampere has their Ampere Altra Max with 128 Arm Neoverse N1 cores. The Altra outperforms the AMD EPYC 7763 with 64 cores which are regarded as the fastest x86 CPU. Amazon has come out with their Graviton3 chip with 64 Neoverse V1 cores. Meanwhile, Nvidia has announced their Grace super-chip which will have 144 Neoverse V2 cores.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overview of current and coming high-performance Arm processors.\n",
        "It might be interesting to note the difference between the Neoverse N and V cores. The N variants are for traditional server workloads while the V variants are for high-performance computing (HPC). With HPC we typically mean scientifically oriented workloads such as machine learning, lots of matrix multiplications, and other floating-point operations.\n",
        "So you can imagine you might want the Neoverse N cores for hosting databases and web servers while you would use Neoverse V for machine learning, data analysis, simulations, etc.\n",
        "The important point is that Arm chips exist for all markets. Apple makes the Arm chips that can compete in the desktop and laptop consumer space. Amazon, Ampere, and Nvidia supply the Arm chips which can compete in data centers.\n",
        "But x86 won in the 90s over RISC! Sorry, but the rules have changed. Arm has higher volume today and Arm chip makers have access to equal or superior manufacturing through companies such as TSMC.\n",
        "What About RISC-V?\n",
        "It is not just when talking about Arm chips that the x86 victory over RISC in the 1990s is mentioned. It is also a point raised whenever somebody talks about the future of RISC-V. Again exactly the same story applies to RISC-V as with Arm. RISC-V chips can in principle be built by TSCM so there is no node size advantage for Intel.\n",
        "What about volume? RISC-V-like Arm is starting at the low end where volume is high. RISC-V processors are going into hard drive controllers, mice, keyboards, Bluetooth devices, IoT, and a dozen other things today. Thus RISC-V is a lot more like Arm than the UltraSPARC, MIPS, and Alpha RISC processors of the 1990s.\n",
        "Of course, it will take time for RISC-V to gain the kind of popularity and performance Arm enjoys today, but there is nothing stopping RISC-V from beating x86 chips sometimes in the future. However, by the time RISC-V is competing in the high-performance space I doubt there are any x86 chips around to compete against. The future will more likely be a battle between Arm and RISC-V. But you should give RISC-V at least another 5–6 years before you can expect it to be going up against Arm.\n",

The lone arrest on the U.S. mainland was in Miami, Florida.\n\nDrug Enforcement Special Agent in Charge Javier Pena said the airline industry cooperated in the investigation.\n\n\"By denying the drug traffickers alternate smuggling routes, we disrupt the flow of drugs into Puerto Rico and discourage the use of the island as a transshipment point in the Caribbean,\" he said in a news release.\n\nThe agency said that if they are convicted, the defendants taken into custody would face sentences ranging from 10 years to life in prison and personal fines of up to $4 million.\n\nAmerican Airlines issued a statement confirming some employees had been arrested, but could not confirm the number because of its privacy policy, spokesman Tim Wagner said in an e-mail.

Officials in Washington and Bishkek signed a deal three years ago allowing the United States to renew the arrangement annually through July 2011.\n\n\"We do remain in contact with the government of Kyrgyzstan,\" Yerkin said. \"The Manas Air Base continues to operate under existing agreements, as per the coalition's efforts in Afghanistan.\"\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Friday the United States will continue to work with Kyrgyzstan on keeping the base open.   Watch why Kyrgyzstan wants to close the base »\n\n\"I continue to believe that this is not a closed issue and that there remains the potential at least to reopen this issue with the Kyrgyz and perhaps reach a new agreement,\" Gates said at a NATO meeting in Krakow, Poland. \"If we are unable to do that on reasonable terms then, as I have suggested, we are developing alternative methods to get resupply and people into Afghanistan.\"\n\nThe Manas Air Base outside Bishkek is the only U.S. base in Central Asia and is a major resupply hub for the war in Afghanistan.\n\nIts closing could deal a significant blow to the U.S. military effort there, especially following President Barack Obama's announcement of additional troops to halt a resurgence of the country's former Taliban rulers.\n\nThe United States pays $17.4 million a year to use Manas, a major logistical and refueling center that supports troops in Afghanistan, the Pentagon said. About 15,000 troops and 500 tons of cargo reportedly move through Manas monthly, it said.\n\nThe air base currently employs more than 1,000 servicemen, 95 percent of whom are Americans, Russia's Interfax news agency reported.\n\n\"This is an important facility, it has been an important facility, but it's not irreplaceable and, if necessary, we will find other options,\" Whitman said.

That's like Venice without canals -- and just as hard to imagine. Music weaves New Orleans' past with its present, and the infinite jazz variations -- from the ethereal warble of classic Dixieland to the tuba-powered street funk of brass bands -- serve as a soundtrack to this storied city.\n\nThe best way to keep New Orleans music alive? Visit.\n\nNew Orleans music sounds sweeter today, and here's why: In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, few were certain the streets would resound as they once did.\n\nIt's not that clubs flooded and venues were wiped out -- many were on high ground and survived just fine -- but the rising waters took out much of the city's affordable housing and its tourism industry. That uncertain future made it unclear whether pass-the-hat musicians and hardworking club regulars would be able to regain their footing in the city.\n\nBut several groups took the lead to ensure that musicians would still have a home in New Orleans. Locally revered nightclub Tipitina's earmarks its proceeds to help musicians return to town and to put musical instruments back into the flooded schools.\n\nHarry Connick Jr. and Branford Marsalis, two New Orleans natives, partnered with Habitat for Humanity to build the Musicians' Village in the Upper Ninth Ward. Today, this cluster of colorful shotgun-style cottages, located an easy bike ride from the French Quarter, is gradually being filled by musicians (and others) as volunteers continue to travel here to build the houses. CoastalLiving.com: Beyond Bourbon Street\n\nWhile some still debate whether the music scene has fully regained its pre-storm luster, there's no denying that anyone who shows up hungry for the famous New Orleans sound will leave sated. You can still stroll the French Quarter or nearby Frenchmen Street and pass dozens of clubs where languid notes wander out into the muffled, humid air, pause for a moment, and disappear into the night.\n\nThe best way to keep New Orleans music alive? Visit. And bring your friends. Go to clubs. Here are four not to miss.\n\nSnug Harbor Jazz Bistro has the feel of a speakeasy -- you enter through a low-ceilinged bar into an open performance space that's at once intimate and grand. With live music nightly, this is a good spot for classic, straight-ahead jazz. Expect talents such as Ellis Marsalis (father of Branford and Wynton), Charmaine Neville (a member of New Orleans' first family of music), and powerhouse trumpet player Irvin Mayfield with his New Orleans Jazz Orchestra. CoastalLiving.com: Gulf Coast Eateries\n\nThree decades ago, a handful of local musicians was dismayed that piano legend Professor Longhair had no place to showcase his talents. They acquired a bar Uptown (it's about a 10-minute cab ride from the French Quarter), and renamed the venue after the Professor's signature song.\n\nToday Tipitina's, a spacious, two-level club in a boxy yellow building marked by a Dixie beer sign, attracts local and touring musicians ranging from inimitable songwriter-composer Allen Toussaint to rising stars such as Troy \"Trombone Shorty\" Andrews. Seating is nonexistent -- assume you'll be standing the whole show --but the open space works to your advantage on Sunday evenings, when Tip's hosts a Cajun dance party, with the emphasis on dance.\n\nFor the gold standard of New Orleans performance venues, visit Preservation Hall. Carved out of a 1750 Creole residence in the heart of the French Quarter, it's had the self-appointed mission of preserving local music since 1961. The audience lines up on the sidewalk, crowds in (it's one of the few places in town to enjoy music without smoke), then taps their feet along with bands schooled in the old ways of New Orleans. Great local musicians perform regularly, all linked by their devotion to traditional music. Thursdays are typically brass-band nights, where the \"big\" gets put in \"big New Orleans sound.\n\nWhen people imagine a laid-back New Orleans jazz club, they're thinking of a place like Donna's Bar and Grill. Smoky and utterly un-self-conscious, the corner bar sits on a fringe of the French Quarter where few tourists happen by. Inside, it's too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter. Black-and-white photos of venerable New Orleans bands hang unevenly on the walls.\n\nBut the music! It showcases a revolving cast of local greats, with Monday gigs by George French and vocalist Germaine Bazzle, and rollicking appearances by barrelhouse piano player Tom McDermott. Arrive before the show to get one of the handful of seats at the bar or in front of the low stage, grab a cold beer, then let the music take you away.\n\nIt's not too early to plan a trip to New Orleans for the French Quarter Festival, featuring more than 150 musical performances on 18 stages. The event runs April 17-19, 2009.

So maybe if he were alive today, President George Washington could tell a New York City library what he did with two books he checked out 221 years ago.\n\nThe two books -- weighty discourses on international relations and parliamentary debates -- were checked out on October 5, 1789.\n\nThey were due on November 2, 1789, but weren't brought back.\n\nSince then, they've been steadily collecting a fine of a few cents each day, adding up to more than $4,000 by the New York Society Library's informal estimate.\n\n\"I'm sorry, math is not my thing at all,\" said Jane Goldstein, the assistant head librarian when asked to hazard a guess.\n\nThe fine at the time was 2 pence a day. Now, it's 15 cents -- \"It's really gone up, hasn't it?\" she quipped.\n\nOne of the librarians, Matthew Haugen, guessed the fine to be in the region of 3,000 British pounds, or about $4,577.\n\n\"He stuck with the pence concept,\" Goldstein said.\n\nThe library first learned of the missing books when it discovered a yellowed ledger in its basement\n\nIt listed all the people who had checked out books from the city's oldest library between July 1789 and April 1792.\n\nNext to the works \"Law of Nations\" and the 12th volume of \"Common Debates\" was the name of the person who checked them out: \"President.\"\n\nAt the time, New York was the capital of the United States, and the library was the only one in town.\n\nSoon after, the capital was relocated to Philadelphia and then Washington D.C.\n\nThe New York library, a subscription library that was New York's first library open to the public, has known about the missing books since the 1930s. The matter came up again recently because the library is capturing the ledgers in digital form to preserve the records.\n\nLibrary officials cross-checked the books mentioned in the ledger with the ones in their collection.\n\n\"Volume 12 (of \"Common Debates\") was still missing,\" as was the other book, Goldstein said.\n\nThe library is not so concerned about the fine as it is about each book.\n\n\"We don't know where it is,\" she said. \"We have tried to find it and we can't,\" she said.\n\n@highlight\n\nGeorge Washington has racked up a growing fine on two overdue books from NYC library\n\n@highlight\n\nThe discourses on international relations, parliamentary debates were never returned\n\n@highlight\n\nNew York Society Library would like to track down the books\n\n@highlight\n\nThe library has known about the missing books since the 1930s\nWho has racked up a fine?\n\n\n\n"

At the time workstations from companies such as Sun, Silicon Graphics and Acorn were hot stuff. Computers magazines had lots of stories about them. I remember going to conferences back then and seeing mostly Unix workstations rather than Windows machines. However, within a relatively few years these Unix workstations were pretty much all gone.',\n 'The question people cannot stop asking is: Why would history not repeat itself? Will x86 not always end up victorious in the end?',\n 'To understand why this will not happen this time around, we need to understand why RISC workstations lost back in the day and why then everything will be different this time around.',\n 'Intel’s Volume Advantage in the 90s',\n 'Production volume matters a lot when it comes to the cost of chips. Large and advanced independent chip manufacturers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), which makes chips for Apple and many others today, did not exist in the 90s.',\n 'The one who had the most advanced manufacturing capability and the highest volume was Intel. RISC processors at the time were cheaper to design as they were simpler. However, lower volume meant higher unit prices.',\n 'Intel had the opposite situation. They had much higher design costs as the x86 instruction set made chips harder to design. However, due to their volume, they could produce chips at a lower cost per unit.',\n 'For high-end workstations which would be low volume, there was an obvious advantage with RISC chips. You could design higher-performance chips at a lower cost. For low-volume workstations, Intel would not be able to compete as their design cost could not be amortized across enough volume of chips.',\n 'The Unix workstations ended up with advanced custom-made hardware at every level which supported all sorts of fancy features such as hot-plugging hardware at runtime, and extremely fast memory. I think some workstations even let you add a CPU while it was running but don’t quote me on that.',\n 'Combined this produced awesome RISC machines at eye-watering prices.',\n 'Open vs Closed Platform',\n 'Closed platforms may give a better overall user experience, just look at Apple. The problem is that you end up with premium prices. All the RISC workstation vendors were like Apple: They sold premium products at premium prices.',\n 'The problem with such a business model is that the low-end competitor always ends up improving and closing in on you. The low-end has the benefit of volume which means high-end products very often lose out to low-end products moving up the value chain.',\n 'The Threat of “Good Enough”',\n 'The problem for RISC-based workstations was that eventually, PCs started getting good enough. They still had flaws compared to RISC-based workstations but the PCs could offer far more software and much lower prices. Thus Intel started gradually eating into the market of RISC workstations which then had to decide whether to fight in the low-end of their business or try to race ahead at the high-end.',\n 'With higher volume and higher total profits, Intel could afford to throw a lot more money at designing chips than the RISC guys. They could also use smaller node sizes to increase performance without actually having better-designed chips than the RISC guys. This made Intel gradually erode the RISC advantage.',\n 'They never stood a chance because they began at the high-end not the low end.',\n 'Did Pentium Become More RISC-like Kill RISC Processors?',\n 'In 1996 Intel shipped the Pentium Pro (P6) and their marketing material started hyping up the chip had basically been a RISC processor which could run x86 instructions. It was sold as having an exterior that could chop up x86 instructions into RISC instructions. A lot of people will point to this transition as the real reason Intel won. But there are many problems with that story. Bob Colwell who designed the Pentium Pro at Intel actually vehemently rejects that there is anything RISC-like about the processor:',\n 'Intel’s x86’s do NOT have a RISC engine “under the hood.” They implement the x86 instruction set architecture via a decode/execution scheme relying on mapping the x86 instructions into machine operations, or sequences of machine operations for complex instructions, and those operations then find their way through the microarchitecture, obeying various rules about data dependencies and ultimately time-sequencing.',\n 'The “micro-ops” that perform this feat are over 100 bits wide, carry all sorts of odd information, cannot be directly generated by a compiler, are not necessarily single cycle. But most of all, they are a microarchitecture artifice — RISC/CISC is about the instruction set architecture.',\n 'This debate has been ongoing for a long time. I wrote a story comparing RISC and CISC getting into this very topic: What Does RISC and CISC Mean in 2020?',\n 'Joel Hruska followed up with a great article later which makes a different conclusion from mine: RISC vs. CISC Is the Wrong Lens for Comparing Modern x86, ARM CPU.',\n 'Actually, I think Joel makes the most compelling arguments, but I will not delve into those details here. One can debate this issue at length but at the end of the day, it is not that relevant. Intel found ways to combat the advantage of RISC processors but there was still no inherent technical advantage in having a CISC processor. Having an x86 instruction set did not give Intel processors a performance advantage no matter how you look at it. At the end of the day having more cash to spend on making better micro-architecture and more sophisticated manufacturing made the difference.',\n 'Why RISC Today is Totally Different From the 90s',\n 'Today the chip game is completely reverse. Arm did not start by selling high-end RISC workstations. Instead, they began by dominating the low-end chips market made up of micro-controllers, embedded devices, dumb phones, and smartphones. In 2020 25 billion Arm-based chips got shipped. In comparison, the whole PC market in 2020 was 275 million units. Think about that! That is two orders of magnitude difference.',\n 'Here is a crazy fact few seem to have picked up about the world we live in today. People are used to thinking about Apple as being the small player. Macs have about a 10% market share of the computer market. So in people’s minds, Apple is a small player. What people fail to take into account is how dominant smartphones and tablets have become. An iPhone today frequently costs significantly more than a desktop computer or laptop. You got plenty of smartphones capable of outperforming low-end PCs.',\n 'These devices have high-end CPUs in them. Many of Apple’s iPad models have M1 chips inside. The very same chip used in many of their popular desktops and laptops. Thus in terms of CPU capability, it does not make that much sense to separate these markets. So here is a simple statistic that will blow your mind: Apple shipped a total of 285 million iPhones, iPads, and Macs in 2020.',\n '',\n 'Comparing the total PC market with total units shipped by Apple with Arm chips inside',\n 'Thus there are more CPUs going into Apple products than there are CPUs going into the whole PC market. Thus being king-of-the-hill in the PC market isn’t that big of a deal. This market is what Intel owns but it simply isn’t that big of a market. Apple alone is making of CPUs than Intel.',\n 'So if you look at the whole Arm market it is clear that the idea that x86 is still the dominant player is just ludicrous. Arm already won. Intel and AMD today are where the RISC workstation guys were in the 90s. They god the high high-end while facing a high-volume competitor which is rapidly catching up.',\n 'x86 Performance Edge is Not Going to Hold',\n 'The fastest supercomputers today are built using Arm,s not x86 chips. Intel and AMD are able to outperform the chips made by Apple but only at the cost of insane power usage. That is not a sustainable strategy to maintain an edge. Apple has the clear lead in terms of performance per watt. Now Apple cares more about slim design and long battery life than Intel and AMD which both make a lot of money on delivering to data centers. Thus they are not directly competing across the whole product lineup.',\n 'But other companies such as Amazon, Ampere, and Nvidia are making Arm chips for data centers which will compete directly with AMD and Intel. Ampere has their Ampere Altra Max with 128 Arm Neoverse N1 cores. The Altra outperforms the AMD EPYC 7763 with 64 cores which are regarded as the fastest x86 CPU. Amazon has come out with their Graviton3 chip with 64 Neoverse V1 cores. Meanwhile, Nvidia has announced their Grace super-chip which will have 144 Neoverse V2 cores.',\n '',\n 'Overview of current and coming high-performance Arm processors.',\n 'It might be interesting to note the difference between the Neoverse N and V cores. The N variants are for traditional server workloads while the V variants are for high-performance computing (HPC). With HPC we typically mean scientifically oriented workloads such as machine learning, lots of matrix multiplications, and other floating-point operations.',\n 'So you can imagine you might want the Neoverse N cores for hosting databases and web servers while you would use Neoverse V for machine learning, data analysis, simulations, etc.',\n 'The important point is that Arm chips exist for all markets. Apple makes the Arm chips that can compete in the desktop and laptop consumer space. Amazon, Ampere, and Nvidia supply the Arm chips which can compete in data centers.',\n 'But x86 won in the 90s over RISC! Sorry, but the rules have changed. Arm has higher volume today and Arm chip makers have access to equal or superior manufacturing through companies such as TSMC.',\n 'What About RISC-V?',\n 'It is not just when talking about Arm chips that the x86 victory over RISC in the 1990s is mentioned. It is also a point raised whenever somebody talks about the future of RISC-V. Again exactly the same story applies to RISC-V as with Arm. RISC-V chips can in principle be built by TSCM so there is no node size advantage for Intel.',\n 'What about volume? RISC-V-like Arm is starting at the low end where volume is high. RISC-V processors are going into hard drive controllers, mice, keyboards, Bluetooth devices, IoT, and a dozen other things today. Thus RISC-V is a lot more like Arm than the UltraSPARC, MIPS, and Alpha RISC processors of the 1990s.',\n 'Of course, it will take time for RISC-V to gain the kind of popularity and performance Arm enjoys today, but there is nothing stopping RISC-V from beating x86 chips sometimes in the future. However, by the time RISC-V is competing in the high-performance space I doubt there are any x86 chips around to compete against. The future will more likely be a battle between Arm and RISC-V. But you should give RISC-V at least another 5–6 years before you can expect it to be going up against Arm.',\n 'Related Stories',\n 'If you are interested in reading more of my stories about microprocessors, CISC, and RISC you may find some of these interesting:',\n 'What the Heck is a Micro-Operation? — Micro-operations is a concept that pops up often when discussing modern RISC and CISC processors.
